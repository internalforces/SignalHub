## Technical Debt

| ID | Description | Impact | Target Resolution |
|----|-------------|--------|--------------------|
| DEBT-001 | `CsvConnector` (Task 8 of the implementation plan) parses rows with a plain `split(",")` — no RFC 4180 quoting/escaping support, so values containing commas or quoted fields will misparse | Low for the MVP (canonical `metricId,timestamp,value` files); would break on hand-exported CSVs with embedded commas | Revisit if Phase 2+ needs richer CSV input, or if a user reports a real file that breaks it |
| DEBT-002 | No ESLint/Prettier configured; `standards.md` code style section is only partially specified (indentation is inferred, max line length and coverage threshold are TBD) | Style drift risk as more agents contribute | Add before M2 (GitHub connector) once more contributors are active |

## Resolved

| ID | Description | Resolved | Method |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| ISS-001 | Percentage-change detector emitted a decrease signal for unchanged adjacent values | 2026-07-29 | Explicitly suppress zero-percent changes; added regression test |
| ISS-002 | Random signal IDs made repeated analysis non-deterministic and allowed duplicate signal persistence | 2026-07-29 | Deterministic IDs derived from detector configuration and signal inputs; added persistence regression test |
| ISS-003 | CLI accepted malformed or unknown flags silently | 2026-07-29 | Validate supported flags, values, and missing arguments; added regression tests |
| ISS-004 | GitHub Actions could not resolve Node built-in module types during the CSV connector build | 2026-07-29 | Declared the Node 20 type definitions at the workspace root and refreshed the lockfile |
